#Sliding Puzzle wout UI

You might call them sliding puzzles or mystic squares.
The idea is that you are presented with numbers 1, 2 and 3 in a grid of 4 spaces,
with 3 numbers in a random order and one empty space.
To solve such a puzzle exchange the empty space with
one of its neighbor numbers, to get the numbers displayed in order with the
empty space at the end.

A brute force algorithm (no intelligence) with an upper exchange limit of 1000
is used.
